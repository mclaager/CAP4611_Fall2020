This holds coursework that was completed for the Algorithms for Machine Learning class at UCF.

## Notable Contents

### Credit Card Fraud Detection
Introduces a dataset that first needs to be filtered, imputed, and re-worked to allow for more accurate training. Non-neural based machine learning approaches are used to attempt to discern whether if financial transactions are fraudulent, along with automatic hyperparameter tuning using Bayesian Optimization. It details the process and the reasoning behind the creation of the models.

### Glass Dataset Exploration
Uses guassian fitting to learn relationships between features of a dataset, and then builds a Support Vector Machine (SVM) model to classify different types of glass. Also shows how re-weighting features can lead to better model performance.

### Iris Dataset Exploration
Uses K-Nearest Neighbors to classify flowers based off of their petals.
